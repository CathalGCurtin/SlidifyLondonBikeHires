## Introduction

The following slides cover the following
- Data set on which application is based 
- Intent of application
- Brief description of code
- Brief Description of use

--- .class #id 

## Data set for application
![Barclays Hire Bike](bikeimage.jpg)
- Taken from [London Data Store], data sets available under the [UK Open Government Licence] (OGL) 
- This dataset is for the [Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme] data set

[London Data Store]:http://data.london.gov.uk/
[UK Open Government Licence]:http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/
[Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme]:http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires/resource/e7084341-d2ce-4a13-8859-cbae32106ed1

--- .class #id 

## Intent
- Allow the mean number of bike hires to be seen based on date ranges (from launch date to Feb 2015)
- Can see overall bike hires over bike hire history in plot 
- Rough tool to give indication mean bike hires throughout date range
- Future iterations of app could predict bike availability based on date

--- .class #id 

## Code usage
- Hardcoded date example below for March 2012 for indicative usage

```{r echo=FALSE}
    # Read data from .csv file. We're only interested in first 2 cols but read everything
    cycledata <- read.csv("./tfl-daily-cycle-hires.csv", colClasses="character")
    # Make sure Day column is converted to a date
    cycledata$Day <- as.Date(cycledata$Day, "%d/%m/%Y")
    # Change name of 2nd column to make it a bit tidier
    names(cycledata)[2] <- 'dailybikehires'
    # Now make sure it's numeric
    cycledata$dailybikehires <- as.numeric(cycledata$dailybikehires)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
   hiredates <- subset(cycledata, Day >= '2012/03/01')
   hiredates <- subset(hiredates, Day <= '2012/03/31')
   print("The (rounded to full number) mean bike hire for your date range is : ") 
   round(mean(hiredates$dailybikehires),0)
```

## Application usage
![Shiny Example](shinyimage.jpg)
- Choose start and end date. 
- Side panel updates reactively with date range chosen
- Mean bike hires (rounded) for date range shown in main panel
